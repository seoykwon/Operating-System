# Operating-System
This repository contains SKKU's OS assignment using xv6.

**make sure you use x86 architecture in order to boot xv6 kernel.**

if you are a MAC user, emulating x86, or virtualizing x86 in ARM processor will not fulfill the pre-requisites of xv6.

You need to prepare a server that has x86 architecture.

You can either use a Windows OS and WSL, or ssh to a x86 server. 

Please include any other options available to process this project.
